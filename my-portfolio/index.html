					<p>My name is Jason Portilla, and I am 31 years old. I am originally from New York, but Apopka has been my home since I was 12 years old.  I graduated from Apopka High School in 2003. I then attended the University of Central Florida where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice.</p>  

					<p>Once I graduated in 2009, I pursued a career as a Police Officer for the Orlando Police Department.  I have been a Police Officer for 8 years. During these years, I was assigned to several areas throughout the city patrolling neighborhoods and building a relationship with the community.  I have volunteered to help kids in the community and guide them towards a positive direction.</p>
					<p>During my career, my passion for computers was always in my mind.  Computers has always been something I wanted to pursue.  An opportunity came when I discovered a course offered through the University of Central Florida.  This was my opportunity, so I jumped.
